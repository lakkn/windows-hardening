# HBI CyberPatriot Scripts Windows
### These scripts were made by Lakshay Kansal in *Hackers Bureau of Intelligence* for CyberPatriot *XII - XV*
therefore it is against CyberPatriot rules to utilize these scripts from CyberPatriot *XII - XV*

I recommend that you use these scripts to **build** upon your own knowledge and skills rather than just copying and pasting it verbatum.
You will learn a lot more about PS1 and Command Prompt. Also these scripts can be used for **general** Windows 10 hardening rather than just CyberPatriot specfic hardening.

There is no gain in just building scripts and just running them because it will never give you all the points you need. You need a base understanding of the vulncats and how to approach all of them. If you are just looking for pure statistics, this scripts can consistently give you at least 50 points give or take depending on the round.
