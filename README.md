# HBI CyberPatriot Scripts and Checklists for Windows
### These scripts were made by Lakshay Kansal in *Hackers Bureau of Intelligence* for CyberPatriot *XII - XV*

## Introduction
It is against CyberPatriot rules to utilize these scripts from CyberPatriot *XII - XV* but I encourage you to mess around with them in practice VMs

I recommend that you use these scripts to **build** upon your own knowledge and skills rather than just copying and pasting it verbatum.
You will learn a lot more about PS1 and Command Prompt. Also these scripts can be used for **general** Windows 10 hardening rather than just CyberPatriot specfic hardening.

There is no **gain** in just building scripts and running them because it will **never** give you all the points you need. You need a base understanding of the vulncats and how to approach all of them. If you are just looking for pure statistics, this scripts can consistently give you at least 50 points give or take depending on the round.

Take a look at the checklists to gain a **good** idea of how your thought proccess should be during competition.
